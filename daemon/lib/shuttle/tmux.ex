defmodule Shuttle.Tmux do
  @moduledoc """
  Shared classification of a tmux session's liveness from `tmux has-session`.

  The naive read — "exit 0 means alive, ANY non-zero means dead" — conflates two
  very different outcomes: the session is genuinely *gone* (the worker exited),
  versus the `has-session` command *failed for an environmental reason* (tmux
  binary not on PATH, a transient server hiccup, a fork/exec failure under load).
  Treating the second as death is how a *live* worker gets declared dead and then
  re-dispatched — the resume storm this module exists to prevent.

  So we classify three ways:

    * `:alive`   — exit 0; the session exists.
    * `:gone`    — non-zero AND the output is tmux's own absence message
                   ("can't find session", "no server running", …). A real worker
                   death. The only result that should count toward declaring a
                   worker dead or freeing its name for a fresh dispatch.
    * `:unknown` — non-zero for any other reason. Uncertain — treated as
                   still-present everywhere it matters (the watcher holds instead
                   of striking; dispatch refuses-and-adopts instead of resuming),
                   so uncertainty never kills a live worker. A genuinely-dead
                   worker still emits `:gone` on its next check, so this never
                   strands a dead worker for long.

  worker. Only a confirmed `:gone` frees the slot.
